        "description": "Archaeological excavations show that people have been living on the hill above what’s now the Old Bazaar since at least the Bronze Age. A town was first founded here in the early Byzantine era during the 6th and 7th centuries when the huge blocks of stone still visible in the fortress walls were dragged here from Scupi, the nearby town that was destroyed during the 518AD earthquake. This was the great town of Justinia Prima, founded by Emperor Justinian I (c.482-565). From the 14th to the 20th century the Ottomans used the fortress as a military barracks, expanding the number of towers to 70 of which only three remain today. ",
